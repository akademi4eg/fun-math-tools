Collection of tools for math and machine learning.
==============

Functions for Matlab/Octave that were developed for fun.

* src/build_fractal.m: Creates an image using algorithm similar to one used for Mandelbrot set creation. Modification of base algorithm adds some randomness, so each time you get a different image.
* src/guesser: Predictor for random binary sequences. Expects that sequences a generated by process with short memory, e.g. a human.
* src/unslr: Semi-supervised version of logistic regression model.
* src/nyc-taxi: Framework for NYC Taxi dataset analysis.
